Attached is a python code sample for loading the data into python as three numpy arrays:

x_train: a matrix of size 15485 x 500 (genes x features)
y_train: a vector of length 15485
x_test: a matrix of size 3871 x 500 (genes x features)
From this example, you should continue according to the following steps:

Define a classifier using sklearn
Assess its accuracy using cross-validation (optional)
Fine tune the parameters and return to 2 until happy (optional)
Create submission file. Should be similar to y_train.csv.
Submit at kaggle.com and sit back.
The submission csv file should look like the following:

GeneId,Prediction
1,0.200000
2,0.400000
3,0.800000
4,0.000000
5,0.000000
6,1.000000
...
3870,0.000000
3871,0.400000
The first item on each row is the test gene ID. The second item is the probability given by your model.
